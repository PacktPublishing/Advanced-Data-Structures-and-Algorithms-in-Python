# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/advanced-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
As a developer, you’ll have certainly heard about various data structures and algorithms. However, have you ever thought profoundly about them and their impact on the performance of your applications? If not, it’s high time to take a look at this topic, and this course is a one-stop guide to master it! 
This course will teach you the necessary theory and applications to properly understand the advanced algorithms and data structures that are critical to various problems and how to implement them. We’ll also go hands-on and reveal tips and tricks for optimizations, identifying the right approaches and presenting convincing explanations. And, you will get it all in a modern, popular, and well-documented language: Python. Finally, you’ll learn how to develop complex algorithms that are easy to understand, debug, and reusable in various applications.
By the end of the course, you’ll know how to develop complex algorithms that are easy to understand, debug, and reusable in various applications.
